    "\n",
    "This question serves as a review for the material covered in the course so far. You will implement a very simple version of the game *Battleships* (*Schiffe versenken!*) which lets the user try to find the computer's single ship. Along the way, you will write functions and import packages, and use lists, strings, loops and conditional expressions. Note that this is by no means an efficient implementation - the learning experience is more important. \n",
    "\n",
    "(a) The first step is defining the board. We will use **print**-statements to simulate a rectangular board, where 'O's mark tiles (i.e. spots in the ocean) which have not been uncovered yet, and 'X' denote tiles which have been checked for the ship. Initially, all tiles consists of 'O's.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function **generate_board** that takes two argument, **x_b** and **y_b** and returns a list of list, i.e. a list with **y_b** elements, each of which a list with **x_b** 'O's. In other words, **x_b** corresponds to the number of rows and **y_b** to the number of columns. The function **print_board** provided below should take such a list of list generated by your function and print the board. Test it with a few different input combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Next, we write a function **random_pos** to determine the random position of the ship. Import the **random** package and use the function **randint** in a function that takes **x_b** and **y_b** as inputs and returns a tuple where the first element corresponds to the row and the second element to the column of the ship.\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) Finally, write a function **run_game** that contains the main logic of the game. It takes three arguments,  **x_b**, **y_b** and **max_turn**. The first thing it is supposed to do is to use **generate_board** to define the board (as in question (a)) and to use **random_pos** to determine the position of the computer's ship (as in question (b)). \n",
    "\n",
    "Then, it runs a loop with **max_turn** iterations. In each iteration of the loop, it does the following:\n",
    "- print the current turn (starting at 1 and increasing by 1 in every iteration)\n",
    "- prompt the user to enter a tile (i.e. a row and a column) to check for the ship\n",
    "- if the tile equals the position of the ship, print a corresponding statement to the screen and stop the loop\n",
    "- if the tile does not equal the position of the ship, there are three cases, which should be indicated by suitable **print** statements:\n",
    "(1) the entered tile is outside of the board\n",
    "(2) the entered tile has already been checked\n",
    "(3) the entered tile has not been checked; in this case, replace the \"O\" on the board by an \"X\"\n",
    "No matter which case applies, print the board.\n",
    "- if the last turn has been reached, print a corresponding statement \n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: When writing the code, you can also include a **print** statement that indicates the position of the ship. This makes it easier to test if detecting the ship works properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "(d) Choose some values for **x_b**, **y_b** and **max_turn** and run the game.\n"
