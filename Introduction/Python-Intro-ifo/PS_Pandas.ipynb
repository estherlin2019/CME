The file 'baseball_stats.csv' contains information on more than 18,000 players that have played in the US baseball league MLB at some point. The data includes the name, height and weight of a player, moreover its \"handedness\" (whether he bats with his left or right hand or both), his batting average (the percentage of at-bats in which he recorded a hit) and the number of home runs.\n",

We can use a t-test to check the hypothesis that both groups come from the same population, i.e. that there is no systematic difference and all observed difference is due to sampling. Use the **ttest_ind** function in Scipy's **scipy.stats** module to compute a t-statistic under the null hypothesis\n",

    "**indicators** is a dictionary that contains the data series you want to download (the keys) and the column names you want to give them (the values in the dictionary). For example, for downloading GDP, you can use: ** indicators = {''NY.GDP.MKTP.KD'': 'gdp'}**. We will give you the relevant names for solving the exercises below, but you can also browse the data base yourself. To list all available topics, use **wbdata.get_source()**. There is also a search function that allows you to search for specific data: **wbdata.search_indicators(\"Population\")**\n",

To avoid missing values, we will use data from 1972 to 2012 in our analysis. The following code block will get you started:"
