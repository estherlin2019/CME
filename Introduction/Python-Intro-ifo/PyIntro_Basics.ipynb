    "3. The line(s) following the colon comprise the *code block* that we are executing in each iteration. As you can see above, these lines are *indented*. This is very important, since Python knows the extent of the code block only from indentation, unlike other languages like MATLAB, which mark the end of a code block by an \"end\" statement. If you do not indent the lines in a for-loop or if the number of lines you indent is not the same for all the lines in a code block, you will get an error message. \n",

    "- It is a convention among Python programmers to indent lines in a code block by 4 spaces. In fact, many programs used to write Python code (such as Jupyter or many text editors) will automatically indent the line by 4 spaces when you press Enter after a colon. Moreover, in Jupyter you can also use the *tab key* to indent by 4 spaces.\n",
    "- If you have a code block within a code block, you need to indent by 8 spaces etc (see example below). In other words, indent 4 spaces after every colon. \n",
    "- Indentation will show up again and again when using Python, not only in the context of loops, but also in conditional statements (see below) and functions.\n",
    "- Why using indentation? While it can take some time to get used to (in particular when you have experience in languages which do not use this concept), clean and consistent indentation improves readability and avoids clutter, such as the brackets or end statements used in other languages. \n",
    "\n",
    "A side note: in Python, \"readability\" of code is extremely important and a dominant principle that guides both the design of the language and the way Python programmers should write code. There are countless style guides and guidelines that I encourage you to read. Just as an illustration of the philosophy underlying Python, you can read the \"Zen of Python\":  "
